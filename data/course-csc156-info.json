    "academicIntegrity": "All work submitted must be your own. Collaboration is encouraged on labs and discussions but written submissions must be individual unless specifically designated as group work. Use of AI tools for code generation or analysis is permitted but must be documented and cited. Copying forensic reports or presenting others' analysis as your own constitutes academic dishonesty. First offense: Zero on assignment + academic integrity meeting. Second offense: Failing grade in course + referral to college administration.",
    "collaboration": "Encouraged: Discussing concepts, troubleshooting tools, comparing approaches. Permitted: Helping classmates understand errors or techniques. Prohibited: Copying lab reports, sharing quiz answers, submitting identical work.",
    "aiUsage": "Generative AI can be used in specific assignments in this course. Students will receive guidelines for using AI responsibly, with clear expectations on what is permitted and how to cite your usage. The use of AI tools beyond the guidelines of each assignment is considered plagiarism in this course, and disciplinary actions fall under the plagiarism guidelines."
  },
  "successTips": [
    "Document everything - assume your work may be used in court. Proper documentation is a core forensic skill.",
    "Master the core tools early - spend extra time with Autopsy, Volatility, and Wireshark in the first weeks.",
    "Start homework and projects early - forensic analysis takes longer than you think.",
    "Practice with additional datasets beyond assigned work - repetition builds proficiency.",
    "Join online forensics communities (Reddit r/computerforensics, DFIR Discord) for support and learning.",
    "Follow current forensic cases and techniques in the news - connect concepts to real-world applications.",
    "Keep detailed lab notebooks with screenshots and observations - these help with reports and studying.",
    "Review tool documentation and tutorials - many have advanced features not covered in class.",
    "Consider certification preparation - this course aligns with CFCE, CHFI, GCFE, and GCFA exams.",
    "Attend all labs - hands-on practice with instructor guidance is invaluable and cannot be replicated independently."
