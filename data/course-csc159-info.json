  "description": {
    "catalog": "This course will explore the application of penetration testing methodologies, tools, and techniques to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications. Students will learn ethical hacking approaches following industry-standard frameworks and best practices.",
    "expanded": "Emphasis is placed on understanding penetration testing phases from reconnaissance through reporting. Students complete hands-on labs that progressively build skills in OSINT, social engineering, vulnerability assessment, web application testing, network exploitation, Active Directory attacks, wireless security, cloud security, and automation scripting."
  },
  "purpose": {
    "why": "This course provides essential cybersecurity skills for careers in penetration testing, red team operations, and security consulting. You'll learn how to identify vulnerabilities before attackers do, perform comprehensive security assessments, and communicate findings professionally. These skills are crucial for CompTIA PenTest+ certification, OSCP preparation, and cybersecurity analyst roles.",
    "beyond": "Beyond technical skills, you'll develop critical thinking for security analysis, ethical decision-making under legal constraints, and the ability to communicate complex technical findings to both technical and non-technical audiences—skills essential for any cybersecurity professional."

  "successTips": [
    "Set up virtual lab environment in Week 1 - delays compound quickly",
    "Practice in your home lab regularly - hands-on experience is crucial",
    "Start assignments early - penetration tests take longer than expected",
    "Document everything - screenshots and notes are essential for reports",
    "Attend lab sessions - instructor guidance accelerates learning",
    "Join online communities (TryHackMe, HackTheBox) for additional practice",
    "Read tool documentation - understanding tools deeply improves effectiveness",
    "Focus on methodology over memorization - frameworks guide real engagements",
    "Test ethically - only on authorized systems in controlled environments",
    "Build professional reporting habits early - documentation is half the job"
