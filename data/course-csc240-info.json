  "description": {
    "catalog": "This course covers the mathematical foundations of computer science including logic, proof techniques, sets, relations, functions, counting, discrete probability, graphs, and trees. Students will develop skills in mathematical reasoning, proof writing, and algorithm analysis while implementing key concepts in a programming language.",
    "expanded": "Topics include symbolic logic and proof methods, combinatorics, set theory, graph and tree traversal methods, mathematical induction, recursion, and recurrence relations. Students apply discrete mathematics concepts through programming exercises in Java or C++, developing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills. This course provides essential foundations for advanced study in algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and theoretical computer science."
  },
  "purpose": {
    "why": "Discrete mathematics is the mathematical foundation of computer science, essential for understanding algorithms, data structures, complexity analysis, and software correctness. This course develops the rigorous mathematical reasoning skills needed for advanced CS coursework and professional software development. The combination of theory and programming implementation prepares you for technical interviews, algorithm design, and system analysis.",
    "beyond": "Beyond programming skills, you'll develop logical thinking, proof construction, and problem-solving abilities applicable across all STEM fields. You'll learn to analyze computational complexity, prove algorithm correctness, and make data-driven decisions—skills valued in software engineering, data science, cybersecurity, and research roles."

    "Form study groups to discuss proofs and approaches",
    "Keep detailed notes with worked examples for exam preparation",
    "Test your programs thoroughly with edge cases and various inputs",
    "Review fundamental algebra and logic concepts if needed",
    "Use visualization tools (Visualgo, GeoGebra) to understand graphs and trees",
    "Connect concepts to programming - discrete math is the foundation of CS theory",
    "Prepare note sheets thoughtfully for exams - the process of creating them helps learning",
    "Don't wait until project deadlines - start projects as soon as they're assigned",
    "Practice LeetCode/HackerRank graph and tree problems for additional challenges",
    "Explain concepts to classmates - teaching reinforces your own understanding",
    "Plan for 9-10 hours per week on average, 12-15 hours during project weeks"
