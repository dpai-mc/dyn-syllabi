  "description": {
    "catalog": "This course continues the study of programming and problem-solving introduced in CSC221. Students transition from Java to C++ while exploring advanced topics including data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables), algorithm analysis, recursion, dynamic memory management, and software engineering practices.",
    "expanded": "Emphasis is placed on understanding time and space complexity, implementing efficient algorithms, and applying object-oriented design principles. Students complete hands-on labs and programming projects that build progressively in complexity, culminating in a comprehensive capstone project."
  },
  "purpose": {
    "why": "This course provides the essential foundation for computer science careers and advanced study. You'll learn how to choose and implement the right data structures for complex problems, analyze algorithm efficiency, and write professional-quality C++ code. These skills are crucial for technical interviews, software engineering roles, and upper-division CS courses.",
    "beyond": "Beyond technical skills, you'll develop problem-solving strategies and the ability to evaluate tradeoffs between different algorithmic approaches—skills that transfer to any technical domain."

    "Set up development environment in Week 1 - technical issues compound quickly",
    "Test code frequently - debug in small increments, not all at once",
    "Read compiler errors carefully - they're trying to help!",
    "Practice regularly - programming improves with consistent practice, not cramming"
